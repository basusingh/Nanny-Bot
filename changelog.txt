=====================================================================================

Changes in 2.99 (beta 17)

=============

New Features:

* Changed the underlying technology for making EXE files from perl scripts.
  Previously, Nanny was built with a commercial product called Perl2Exe
  Now, nanny is built with an Open Source program called PerlBin.
    See:  http://perlbin.sourceforge.net/  for details.
  
  Perl2Exe would bundle all components inside the EXE, which is why those
   exe files were so large.  Now, PerlBin uses the "lib" directory to store all
   of the components that were previously bundled inside the exe.  This means
   that the EXE's get smaller, but cannot be moved around now (the lib folder
   must be in the same folder as the EXE)

* Added the !friendlyfire command
   The !friendlyfire command is an improved version of the old !teamkill command.  
        (!teamkill now functions just like !friendlyfire)

    You can set !friendlyfire 0 to turn OFF team damage
    You can set !friendlyfire 1 to turn ON team damage
    You can set !friendlyfire 2 to turn ON reflected team damage
    You can set !friendlyfire 3 to turn ON shared team damage
    
    !friendlyfire off    will function like a 0
    !friendlyfire on    will function like a 1

    Access to the !friendlyfire command is controlled by auth_teambalance

* Added the !teambalance command
   The !teambalance command is for enabling or disabling auto-balanced teams.
   Usage:  !teambalance on       or       !teambalance off
    Access to the !friendlyfire command is controlled by auth_friendlyfire   


* Added an affiliate server announcements feature.  You can define a list
  of servers to monitor.  If at least one person is playing at one of the affiliate 
  servers, then nanny will announce the server name, how many people are
  playing,  what the current map is, and what the game type is (ctf / tdm / etc)
  See the "Server Announcements" section in the config file for details.

* Added the !broadcast command. This allows you to broadcast a message
  out to other servers.   

   Usage:   !broadcast <your message>
   Example:  !broadcast are there any admins around?

  See the "Broadcast Group" section of the config file for more details.
    Note: requires rcon password for each server in the broadcast group.

  Access to the !broadcast command is controlled by auth_broadcast


* Added /tell awareness so that you can privately tell nanny commands.

* Added the !hostname command for changing the server's name.
  Usage:  !hostname Free Beer: No Clue
  Access to the !hostname command is controlled by auth_hostname

* Added PASV FTP support to switch nanny into PASV mode for better
  dealing with FTP transfers through NAT routers.

  Passive FTP support can be enabled with the config option: 
    use_passive_ftp = yes
  (this option is only used if you are using FTP logfiles)


* Added the !forgive command.
  The !forgive command is for making nanny forgive someone for:
    Spam Repeating 
    Penalty Points (for bad words / whining)
    Anti-Idle Timeout

   Usage:   !forgive Doug

   Use this command when nanny is about to kick someone and you want to stop it.
   Only forgives Spam, Penalty Points, and Idle Time.

   Access to the !forgive command is controlled by auth_forgive

* Added the  !big red button  command.  ( Also:  !nuke )
  This command was added for the lulz.
  When executed it will kick every player connected to the server.
  Access to the command is controlled by auth_big_red_button



===============

Bugfixes:

* No longer assumes that voting is on by default.  On startup, Nanny will 
    check the server to learn if voting is enabled or not..

* Will automatically detect when the server crashes now.  This sort of
    makes the !reset command obsolete now, since Nanny resets herself.

* fixed a divide by zero problem in !stats when a player had no registered kills.

* added flood protection for spam protection.  (lol)  Now nanny will only try to
   kick someone a maximum of twice for heavy spamming.  Previously, nanny
   would try to keep kicking the person one time for each time they spammed,
   even after the person had already been kicked.

* fixed the !unban command so it works with or without a # sign on the unban number

* fixed flood protection for auto-defined words.  Previously, if someone would try an
  undefined word, it would still trip the flood protection.  Now the flood protection does
  not trigger until a definition is successfully displayed.

* Made a partial fix of 999 quick-kicks.  Sometimes when the level changes, nanny
  would kick every player in some circumstances.  Now nanny waites for at least
  90 seconds after a map ends before checking ping times again.  This prevents
  MOST of the bad 999 kicks.

# =============== END: Config File Changes for 2.98 to 2.99 ==========================


End of changelog for version 2.99 (beta 17)



=====================================================================================

Changes in 2.98

New Features:

* Added support for detecting and banning name thieves.  Some of the
  new hacks that are out now can steal the names of other players
  while they are hacking.  Nannybot can now detect and ban these
  chaos-causing jerks.  You can enable this feature with the
  config file directive:  ban_name_thieves = yes

* Added map prediction.  You can now use the !nextmap (or !next) 
  command to show what map will be played next (from the server map 
  rotation list).  Access to the command is controled via the
  auth_nextmap directive.  

* Added teamkill control command: !teamkill on  or !teamkill off.
  Access to the !teamkill command is controlled via the 
  auth_teamkill directive.

* Separated !gravity from the auth_fly directive.   Previously, the
  !gravity command was controlled via auth_fly - Now there is a 
  separate access control directive for gravity:  auth_gravity

* Added auth_override - A new level of access that is HIGHER than 
  auth_everything, its the SUPER-admin access, typically reserved for
  the server owner.  It includes all the access that auth_everything
  includes in addtion to providing access to ALL commands, even ones
  that have been explicitly set to 'disabled'  (auth_everying does
  not allow access to things that have been set to to 'disabled')

* Added support for optional MySQL based logging of chat conversation,
  and what the next map will be.

* Changed the behavior of the !gravity and !speed comands, if you use
  the command without a number, it will SHOW what the gravity or
  speed is currently set to. 


Bugfixes:

* improved the player name matching (like for !locate player) code so that 
  it does one more level of color stripping.  This helps with matching names
  that use double color codes.

* fixed the !define command so that you can give definitions to numbers (like 666)

* fixed a bug that would cause stats to display triwce

* the server now does faster lookup of IP addresses after the level changes.
  This should provide ip-based auth access immediately after the level starts.
  (previously, it could take up to 60 seconds for nanny to learn your ip)

* fixed a divide by zero problem with stats that was crashing nanny in rare
  stats scenarios with new names.

* fixed the FTP code that was causing it to die

* fixed First Blood that was caused by falling to your own death.

* Fixed the !unban command that would crash nanny due to database locking

* changed the default for audit_guid0_players to 'no'.  There seems
  to be a bug in the socket code.  It happens REALLY often under
  windows and rarely under linux, but still enough to be annoying.
  For best stability, I recommend leaving audit_guid0_players set to no.

History:
# beta 1 - adding mysql logging for jahazz
# beta 2 - allowed numbers within words for !define - doug and 666
# beta 3 - added prediction for next level, the !nextmap command - jahazzz
# beta 4 - double stats for some reason - LazarusLong
# beta 5 - fixed a bug in map prediction when the list is empty - me
# beta 6 - added one more strip-color in matching_users for double-color coded players
# beta 7 - does an rcon status immediately after a level change - helps with early admin access.
# beta 8 - fixed a divide by zero problem with stats that was crashing nanny. - Google Muffin
# beta 9 - Added periodic mysql database connection repair if it loses the MySQL server. - me
# beta 10 - Fixed a bug in the FTP code that was causing it to die - me
# beta 11 - Added auth_override - a super-admin access that even allows disabled !commands - me
# beta 12 - Added support for detecting and banning name thieves - me
# beta 13 - Fixed a bug in First Blood caused by falling to your death. - me
# beta 14 - Changed gravity and speed to disclose what they are currently set to - me

# beta 16 - Fixed a bug in !unban command that would crash nanny due to database locking - me
# beta 17 - !teamkill on/off via (auth_teamkill) - EmoKid


Config File Changes:
  Assuming that you were previously running version 2.97, 
  you can upgrade your config file by adding the following:

# =============== BEGIN: Config File Changes for 2.97 to 2.98 ==========================

# The !nextmap command
auth_nextmap = everyone

# the highest level of access - auth_override 
#  will allow commands that have been explicityly disabled
# higher than auth_everything access
auth_override = 66.114.146.*
auth_override = 67.183.250.215
auth_override = 66.114.156.48
auth_override = 937779

# ==============================================================
#  descriptions are used for helping the server know what the
#  proper names of levels and gametypes are.  Many of the
#  level names are not intuitive.  These defintions will
#  help nannybot be know what the levels and gametypes are called.

description = dm = Deathmatch
description = tdm = Team Deathmatch
description = ctf = Capture The Flag
description = hq = Headquarters
description = sd = Search and Destroy

description = mp_breakout = Villers-Bocage, France
description = mp_brecourt = Brecourt, France
description = mp_burgundy = Burgundy, France
description = mp_carentan = Carentan, France
description = mp_dawnville = St. Mere Eglise, France

description = mp_trainstation = Caen, France

# ==========================================================================
#
#                            Ban Name Thieves
#
# Some hacks out there will steal names in order to confuse admins and make
# it more difficult to be banned.   Admins and vote-callers are unable
# to distinguish which player is which, but NannyBot can tell them apart!
#
# When enabled, this feature will detect and automatically remove players
# that are stealing other players' names.  It is a most-rude activity that
# is usually also acompanied by a nasty aimbot.  

ban_name_thieves = yes


# =============== END: Config File Changes for 2.97 to 2.98 ==========================


End of changes in 2.98


======================================================================

Changes in 2.97

* Restructured the definitions table so that it keeps manually
  defined definitions separate from the cached definitions
  that were pulled from the online dictionary.

* Added FTP support so that nannybot can now be run from any
  remote computer with an internet connection, as long as the
  CoD2 server allows access to the server logfiles via FTP.

  This should allow many more people to use the program.

  Add this to your nannybot.cfg: 
  # Examples of running nanny on a remote computer and using FTP logfiles
  # ftp_username = your_ftp_username
  # ftp_password = your_ftp_password
  # server_logfile = ftp://127.216.399.18/path/to/cod2/main/games_mp.log

* Added commands for enabling and disabling weapons.
  !smoke on/off
  !grenades on/off
  !shotguns on/off
  
  Access to the weapon control commands are controlled via
  the auth_weapon_control directive.

* writes a nannybot.pid file or a shutdown_nannybot.bat
  Windows users require pskill.exe for bat file based shutdown
  Unix users can kill `cat nannybot.pid` to shut it down

* Made an access directive for exemption from flood protection
  auth_flood_exemption well exempt a user from flood protection.

* Added a !say command - console will say whatever you tell it to.
  access to the !say command is controlled by the auth_say directive.

* Added a !tell command
  Usage !tell <someone> <something>
  like:   !tell SUK you suck!
  Will tell multiple people if there are multiple matches.

* Added a !lastkill command

  Use this command to have console tell you who the most recent person
  to kill you was.  This is handy after you watch a suspicious kill-cam,
  but missed the name of the player who did it.

  access to the !lastkill command is controlled by the auth_lastkill directive.

  People with auth_peek access can !lastkill <someone_else> to find
  out who <someone_else> was last killed by.

* Added a !reset command.
  Use the !reset command after the server crashes.  If you see the
  bot repeatedly trying to kick people that aren't connected, you
  can either restart the nannybot program - or use the !reset command.

  Access to the !reset command is controled by the auth_reset directive.

* Added the !fixaliases command.
  Sometimes the the CoD server messes up and assigns a bunch of people
  incorrect GUID numbers.  This pollutes one of the aliases databases with
  bad information.  Use the !fixaliases command to purge the database
  that gets polluted.  This will delete many records from the aliases
  database, including some records that are correct.  Aliases that are
  associated by IP address will not be affected.

  This will also delete any corrupted names (names that are longer than
  31 charachters)

  Access is controled by the auth_fixaliases directive.

* fixed a bug in the KKRcon library that was causing corrupt aliases
  Traced it to a bug in the actual CoD server code - it drops a byte
  or two from long rcon responses.  Now we mark corrupted / incomplete
  lines with an "X" at the begining of them.

* The output of a !locate command now also displays the player's slot
  slot number.  You can use the slot number with the !kick, !ban, and
  !tempban commands.  Example:   !kick #5

  This is handy when you are trying to kick someone that is changing
  names too fast.  You !locate all - and watch the output for the 
  player's slot number - when you see the slot number, you can then
  !kick #number 

* Added a !time command.  This will show the time - ON THE SERVER.
  This will not localize the time for the player.
  Access to the !time command is controlled via the auth_time command

* Added a !define / !dictionary command / !undefine command
  
  You can use !define <word> to look up <word> in an online dictionary.
  Results are cached in a local database to avoid having to look up
  the word 'sex' 452 times a day.
  
  Users with auth_add_definition access can add and remove defintions.

  To add a new term, you: 
     !define term = defintion   (spacing is important)
  
  You cannot delete individual definitions, but you can delete all
  definitions for a word with the !undefine command.  
  You would:   !undefine term
  Access to the !undefine command is controlled via auth_add_definition

* bug? fix: disabled anti-vote-rush during S&D - very hard to get votes in.

* internally, nanny pays attention to more details when the level changes.
  nanny now knows the current game type, name of the game, friendly fire,
  killcam, the version of COD, the name of the server, maximum number of 
  clients, maximum ping, maximum number of private clients, pure, and voice.

* bug-fix: No more unrecognized syntax for round/wins.  Cleaned up the regex match.
  It now annoucnes which team/player won the level when the game is over.  Losers
  are also spotted now, too.

* bug-fix: On !stats output, now, it will no longer show bullshit calls if 
  bullshit_calls are disabled.

* on !locate commands, now only those from the US will have their distance
  shown in miles.  All other players will now have their distance shown
  in kilometers.

* Added GUID ZEro auditing to remove some people that are using stolen
  CD Keys.   Add this to your nannybot.cfg file:

# ==========================================================================
#
#                            GUID 0 Auditing
#
# GUID Zero auditing will periodically select any random player with GUID 0
#  and ask the Activision server if they are playing with a valid CD Key.
#  Nanny knows how to directly ask activision and can be more patient than
#  the CoD server is.  If Activision responds that the CD Key is banned,
#  then nanny will consider the person to be using a pirated copy and
#  tempbans the person from the server.   (You cannot ban GUID 0 players)
#
# If you want to allow all people to play regardless of the status of their
#  CD Key, valid or not, then disable this feature.  (set it to: no)

audit_guid0_players = yes




==========================================================================================

Changes in 2.96

* Added a !lastbans command.  You can use the !lastbans command to show the
  ten most recent bans and how long ago they were banned.  This makes it
  easier to unban someone, or check to see who was recently banned.
  If 10 bans is too many or not enough, you can specify the number of
  bans you want to see after the command.  Like:   !lastbans 25
  to see the last 25 bans.   50 is the maximum amount that it will show.
  Access to the !lastbans command is controlled by the auth_ban directive.
  Anyone who has access to !ban or !unban someone also has the ability
  to run the !lastbans command.  NOTE:  temporary bans are not listed.  

* Added a new program to the nannybot distribution.  rcon.exe is a slightly
  customized version of the kkrcon perl program.  This version reads the
  server IP, port number, and password from the nannybot.cfg that is in the
  same folder as the rcon.exe.   You should just be able to doubleclick
  the rcon.exe to be able to type rcon commands at your server.

* Added a new program to the nannybot distribution.  geoip.exe is a
  small version of the IP lookup utility that nanny uses to map
  IP addresses to geographic location.   This program operates in one
  of two modes.  It will either take IP addresses from the command line
  or from standard-in.   If no IP addresses are specified on the command
  line, then it read IP addresses from standard in and print back
  the location of each IP.

* Fixed a bug regarding bullshit calls.  There was a bug with the bullshit
  subsystem.  Bullshit calls were going to the wrong person in some cases.
  This has been fixed.   Calling BS too fast, leads to a ''WHINEY BITCH'',
  which will cause the BS call to filed against the person who called BS.

* Fixed a major bug in the KKrcon library. (The perl library used for
  sending rcon commands to the server.)  This bug was related to the rcon
  status command only being able to see the first 13 lines of output.
  This resulted in nanny having to ''guess'' IP addresses for people that
  were in slots that couldn't be ''seen'' by the nanny.  Now, nanny can
  see all slots.  This will eliminate the need to guess IP addresses.
  This will help in some situations when you try to !ban someone. 
  (Nanny is now guaranteed to know the correct IP for every player, which
  does get used in the ban process when the Activision Master is down).
  This will also help with the !locate command (No more ignored !locate
  requests due to nanny not knowing the IP).   This will also help with
  !command authentication for admins when the Activision Master is down.
  Nanny uses IP addresses as fall-back authentication when the master is
  down.  Previously, admins that ended up in a slot above 13 would
  sometimes find their access didn't work.  This should be fixed now.
  (as long as the admin's IP is defined correctly in the config.)

* Added a few fake !commands (actually, just responses) to the nannybot.cfg 
  for things like !beer and !dip

* Added a secret !command.  Not telling.

* Added 'Location Spoofing'.  This will let you configure fake locations
  that people will see when they attempt to !locate someone.  Add the
  following to your config file:
  
# =========================================================================
#
#                              Location Spoofing
#
# You can define arbitrary locations for specific player names.  This
# allows you to make someone appear to come from wherever you like.
#
# General Format is:
#  location_spoofing = Name = Place
#
# spacing is important.
# That's: 'space equals-sign space' is how you separate the name
# matching part from the location part.
#
#  The player's name will automatically be pre-pended to the location.


location_spoofing = Doug = is from ^2Fuck-OffityLand ^7(6 feet from the server)
location_spoofing = Bad\^?\d?robot = is from ^2Planet Pluto ^7(4.3 billion miles from the server)
location_spoofing = Soy.*Sauce = is from ^2Cocomo ^7(off the Florida Keys)
location_spoofing = Jim.*Lahey\b = is from ^2Sunnyville Trailer Park, Canada ^7 (5,420 km from the server)
location_spoofing = \dR.*evelations\b = is from ^2Heaven ^7 (An undetermined distance from the server)
location_spoofing = SUK.*Pride\b = is from ^2Saturn ^7 (933.92 million miles from the server)

Changes in version 2.95

* Added "First Blood".   Nanny will now make an anouncement about the first person to
  make a kill at the begining of a new map.

Add this to your nannybot.cfg:

# ==========================================================================

#                           First-Blood Anouncements

# By enabling this option, console will announce the names of the first
# person to be killed and who killed them.  It makes one announcement
# near the begining of each round.   Search and Destroy is a little
# buggy:  it will announce first blood for each round of S&D.

first_blood = yes


# ==========================================================================


* When you !locate someone, it will now calculate and display how many miles away from
  the server that player is.  No config changes are required.
  Note: Will not function on servers that run with 192.168.* or 10.* IP Addresses.   

* Added flood protection to the automatic responses to player chat events.  This will
  stop the dicks that keep saying "hi" over and over and over.  Penalty points are
  still counted, but the responses are skipped to save time and spam.

* Fixed the !ban and the !tempban command.   The commands are supposed to kick
  you if you try to use them without access.  The tempban kick was broken and
  the ban kick was actually a permaban.  Oops.  I had a couple of users baned
  themselves before I figured out what was happening...

* Added the !speed command.   This command is an rcon mapping to the g_speed
  command.  Use it to change the speed of how fast things happen.
  WARNING:  Setting the speed to very fast causes some sort of corruption
     to the internals of the server that can only be repaired by shutting
     down and restarting the CoD2 server.   I recommend against using high
     speeds unless you like restarting your server.
  It's a novel feature, but somewhat damaging.

  Add this to your nannybot.cfg:
# the !speed command
auth_speed = disabled
# auth_speed = everyone
# auth_speed = 127.65.43.21

* Added the !gravity command
  The gravity command is just a straight mapping of the rcon g_gravity command.
  Use this to set the gravity to different levels for longer than a !fly will.
  800 is default gravity.  10 - everything floats away. 60 is moon gravity.
  Authentication for the !gravity command is provided by auth_fly

* Added the "bullshit" assist that will anounce who you are calling bullshit on.
  This is useful for a number of reasons.  It helps draw attention to potential
  hackers.  It also is useful in kill-cam scenarios where you decide a kill was
  not legitimate after watching the killcam and after the name is gone. This
  will announce that you have called bullshit on the name of the last player
  that killed you.  It is also reflected in the stats of the person that made
  the kill.

  Add this to your nannybot.cfg
# ==========================================================================

#                           Bull-Shit Anouncements

# By enabling this option, console will trigger bullshit calls based on
# certain things that people say after getting killed. It helps draw
# attention to potential hackers.  It also is useful in kill-cam scenarios
  where you decide a kill was not legitimate after watching the killcam
  and after the name is gone. This will announce that you have called
  bullshit on the name of the last player that killed you.  It is also
  reflected in the stats of the person that made the kill.

bullshit_calls = yes


# ==========================================================================


* Added a 2nd stats column that tracks lots more statistics.  Updated the
  output of the !stats command to show some of these new stats.

* Added defense against vote-rushing where you vote at the begining of the level

  add this to your nannybot.cfg:

# ==========================================================================

#                           Anti Vote Rushing

# I added this because I got tired of the people with the fast computers
# calling votes at the begining of a level and getting their votes to
# pass before anybody else even had a chance to join.  When this feature
# is enabled, it will briefly turn voting off at the very begining of
# the level.  This gives more people a chance to join before votes are
# allowed to be called.

anti_vote_rush = yes


# ==========================================================================

* Added killing spree announcements.  Enabling this feature will cause an
  announcement each time a player beats his previous killing spree record.
  So far this looks like a hit, a real crowd-pleaser.

  Add this to your nannybot.cfg
# ==========================================================================

#                           Killing Spree Anouncements

# By enabling this option, console will announce each time a player beats
# his his previous killing spree record.  It is designed to be done in a way
# that minimizes the number of announcements.

killing_sprees = yes

# ==========================================================================

# END OF CHANGES FOR 2.95.  If you are upgrading from 2.94, stop reading now.

==========================================================================================

Changes in version 2.94

* Added a new authentication directive, "auth_everything" which grants access to all commands.
  This makes it easier to give access to everything without having to edit a ton of lines.
  You can add global admin access (to all commands that are not disabled) now with the config
  directive   auth_everything = 

* Rewrote the !help command to be more helpful.  Proper access checks for all commands now.
  You should REMOVE the "help" rule from your nannybot.cfg by deleting these 4 lines:
     rule_name = help
     match_text = ^\!?help\s*$
     penalty = 0
     response = Available Commands:  !stats, !seen, !locate, !awards, !version, !suk

* IP Addresses that are guessed are now marked as such and treated differently.
  The differences are:
    !locate commands against guessed IPs will indicate they are "probably" from somewhere.
    !aliases commands against guessed IPs will indicate they are "probably" aliases.
    all !command auth_* directives will no longer grant users access if their IP is guessed.
  no config changes are required.

* Added an !uptime command that will tell you how long the server has been up and running for.
  Access to the command is controlled by the  auth_uptime  directive (or auth_everything)  

* Added GUID sanity checking.  This attempts to detect when the server is
  recording the wrong GUID number for players. 
  (This feature will not work on "cracked" servers since all users have GUID 0)
  GUID sanity checking is meant to detect when the server is recording the wrong
  GUID number for players.  Restart the COD2 server and the nanny to fix GUID
  sanity problems.

  Add this to your nannybot.cfg:
# ==========================================================================

#                         GUID sanity checking.

# This attempts to detect when the server is recording the wrong GUID number
# for players.  When the server is "unsane" it will have bad data that will
# screw up the !aliases command AND may cause you to unintentionally ban the
# wrong people.  I have had MY OWN guid banned when banning other people.
#
# I dont yet know if Windows-based servers have this problem.  So far I have
# only observed this problem on linux-based servers.
#
# Note: This feature will not work on "cracked" servers since all users have
#  GUID 0.  When GUID sanity checks fail, Restart the COD2 server and the
#  nannybot to fix GUID sanity problems.

# If you dont want to use GUID sanity checking, you can disable it here.

guid_sanity_check = yes


# ==========================================================================



* There is now a ban database that records the Name, IP address, and GUID of users
  that get !banned or !tempbanned.  It may take a minute, but if nanny notices
  a user playing from an IP address that is banned, It will kick that player. This
  will help keep banned players out when the Activision master server is down or slow.
  This will also allow banning of people on "cracked" servers.

* There is now an !unban command to remove temporary or permanant bans.   You can 
  !unban someone by specifying the ban ID number.  (Like:  !unban 27)  Access to the unban
  command is controlled by auth_ban or auth_everything.

# ==========================================================================

* Added flood protection.  This makes it so that you have to wait for a while between 
  issuing !commands.  This is designed so that people can't tie the nannybot up for long
  periods of time by issueing lots of commands.  I had one user that would say !awards 
  over and over and over again, and the nanny would take almost an HOUR to stop printing
  out awards.   No more.  If you try a command and it does nothing, it probably means
  that flood protection is stopping it.  Wait for a minute or two and try the command again.

# If you want users to be able to flood commands, you can disable this setting.

# I recommend that you leave this setting enabled.
